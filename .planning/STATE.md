# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-23)

**Core value:** Every unit of field work flows through one trustworthy loop — worker submits → auditor approves on-site → central project data (BOQ + map) updates automatically
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (foundation) — EXECUTING
Plan: 3 of 7 (02b next)
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-05-24

Progress: [██░░░░░░░░] 28%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: BOQ line item selected by worker via inline keyboard (State 2.5) between photo and location; AI parses notes to auto-suggest classification (advisory)
- Roadmap: Multiple auditors per project; first action wins; race-safe via SELECT FOR UPDATE + status guard
- Roadmap: AI flags are advisory only; eval harness with acceptance criteria required before flags shown to auditors (AI-05)
- Schema (01-02a): geometry(LineString,4326) generated correctly by drizzle-kit customType — Pitfall 1 hand-edit did not trigger for drizzle-kit 0.31.x
- Schema (01-02a): getDefaultTenantId() pattern established — all app code MUST supply tenant_id on insert (Pitfall 3 prevention)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 2: grammY conversations replay semantics — all DB calls must use `conversation.external()`; write duplicate-update integration test on day one
- Phase 3: BOQ double-deduction — use `SELECT FOR UPDATE` with `WHERE status='pending_audit' RETURNING id`; `CHECK (approved_qty <= planned_qty)` as DB guard
- Phase 4: PostGIS coordinate order — `ST_MakePoint(longitude, latitude)`; unit test required before merging
- Phase 4: Geometry vs geography — use `::geography` cast for metre-accurate distance thresholds
- Phase 1: Drizzle LineString migration requires manual SQL edit to change generated type from `geometry(point,4326)` to `geometry(linestring,4326)`
