# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-23)

**Core value:** Every unit of field work flows through one trustworthy loop — worker submits → auditor approves on-site → central project data (BOQ + map) updates automatically
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 6 (Foundation)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-05-23 — Roadmap created; 6 phases defined, all 38 v1 requirements mapped

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: BOQ line item selected by worker via inline keyboard (State 2.5) between photo and location; AI parses notes to auto-suggest classification (advisory)
- Roadmap: Multiple auditors per project; first action wins; race-safe via SELECT FOR UPDATE + status guard
- Roadmap: AI flags are advisory only; eval harness with acceptance criteria required before flags shown to auditors (AI-05)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 2: grammY conversations replay semantics — all DB calls must use `conversation.external()`; write duplicate-update integration test on day one
- Phase 3: BOQ double-deduction — use `SELECT FOR UPDATE` with `WHERE status='pending_audit' RETURNING id`; `CHECK (approved_qty <= planned_qty)` as DB guard
- Phase 4: PostGIS coordinate order — `ST_MakePoint(longitude, latitude)`; unit test required before merging
- Phase 4: Geometry vs geography — use `::geography` cast for metre-accurate distance thresholds
- Phase 1: Drizzle LineString migration requires manual SQL edit to change generated type from `geometry(point,4326)` to `geometry(linestring,4326)`
